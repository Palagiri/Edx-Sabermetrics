We can use the Aggregate function in SQL queries : Following is to find Average of (H) 
>>select avg (H) as AVG_H, 
yearID, 
H/AB as BA 
from Batting 
Where playerID = 'canoro01';

#Usage of ORDER BY ,
#HAVING
# GROUP BY
>>select playerID, SUM(HR) as HR_CAREER
from Batting 
where teamID = 'OAK'
Group by playerID
having HR_CAREER >= 100
limit 10

#There are many aggregate functions
SUM(<column>)
AVERAGE(<column>)
COUNT(<coulmn>)
MIN(<column)
MAX(<column>)
STDDEV(<column>)
VARIENCE(<column)
from <table name>

#HAVING is a SQL syntax that can be used on the Aliases
#Aliases can not be used in the where clause
#order by should always be used in the last.
>>SELECT playerID, yearID, teamID, AB, H, HR, 
    H/AB AS BA, 
    (H+BB+HBP)/(AB+BB+HBP+SF) AS OBP, 
    (H+2B+2*3B+3*HR)/AB AS SLG
FROM Batting
WHERE yearID = 2013 AND AB > 50
HAVING SLG >= 0.450
ORDER BY SLG DESC



SELECT ((H+BB+HBP)/(AB+BB+HBP+SF) + (H+2B+2*3B+3*HR)/AB)) as OPS FROM Batting WHERE yearID=1969 and playerID='jonescl01'
